# 911-the-game

this is a game where you try to fly a plane and not crash into the building <strike>and create another 911-like fiasco.</strike> jk. <br>
essentially, this is a game where you have to fly your paper plane over the colosseum of rome, and try not to crash. <br><br>
for laptop users, you use [spacebar] to jump over the building. for phone users, you use the [tap function] on your phone in the white space to jump. <br><br>
<b>IMPORTANT</b> thing to note is that, bgm is off by default. click on the amp logo to start playing the music before starting the game.
